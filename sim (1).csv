The system generates and authorizes instructions for funds transfers and payments between sender and recipient of participating institutions. The participating institutions of the sender and recipient of the funds transfer/payment may be the same or different, and may be located within the same or different countries. The system and method generates and authorizes funds transfer/payment instructions using the phone number of the recipient as identifying information and without providing banking particulars of the recipient. In some embodiments, the system implements an interactive voice response (IVR) application allowing a user to interact with the system using voice prompts responsive to the user's spoken response in the telephone receiver or the user input on the keypad of the user's touch-tone wired or wireless telephone. In some embodiments, the phone number of either or both of the sender and recipient may be shared among multiple users.",2007-08-02,CPNI Inc.,"Terrence Patrick Bird, Biswajit Nayak, Siraj Berhan",https://api.projectpq.ai/patents/US20070179885A1/thumbnails/1,69.59,22.36,86.81,53.43

9,US6206283B1,https://patents.google.com/patent/US6206283B1/en,Method and apparatus for transferring money via a telephone call,""" An individual transfers money from a cash card (or the account that the cash card is tied to) by making a wireless phone call to another individual. A combination of a MONDEX style card with the individual phone cards are used for this purpose. This electronic cash (""""ecash"""") ecash/phone card is inserted into the phone to activate it for billing use and serves as the basis for a cash transaction. For example, person A makes a telephone call to person B and dials a suffix after the number to indicate the transaction and the amount. For example, one could transfer money to another card or account holder from one's card by dialing their number followed by CASH#200# to transfer 200 dollars to the other account. The card is then capable of being used as a cash card to make purchases or as a phone card to make calls. A database links the identity of the caller to the cash account and the transaction appears as part of a bank statement or as part of a wireless phone bill. A user could use his wireless phone to dial an account number and transfer money by entering the amount via DTMF or by speaking the amount to an ASR application connected to the database. A user could also use the phone to make purchases via the card by just dialing a number and having an anonymous purchase made of the item. Since the user would be identified by the wireless network, the user would not have to enter any additional information about identification or credit card. The number that the user dialed could then debit the user's card directly and the item could be delivered without any need for the user to enter more information.
